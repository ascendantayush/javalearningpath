// Discount and Revenue
// Revenue	can	be	calculated	as	the	selling	price	of	
// the	product	times	the	quantity	sold,	i.e.	revenue	
// =	price	Ã—	quantity.	Write	a	program	that	asks	the	
// user	 to	 enter	 product	 price	 and	 quantity	 and	
// then	 calculate	 the	 revenue.	 If	 the	 revenue	 is	
// more	 than	 5000	 a	 discount	 is	 10%	 offered.	
// Program	 should	 display	 the	 discount	 and	 net	
// revenue.
